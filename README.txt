This package contains MATLAB scripts for fluctuation electron microscopy data analysis of a set of 
electron nanodiffraction patterns acquired in TIA on an FEI electron microscope.  It calculates the annular 
average of each nanodiffraction pattern, then the variance of many annular averages.  It uses a 
simultaneously acquired annular dark-field image for thickness filtering of the FEM data set, as described 
in [1].

Other types of data analysis and other input data types are not currently supported.
